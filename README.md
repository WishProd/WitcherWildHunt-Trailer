# WitcherWildHunt-Trailer

This project was an exercise in sound desgin for visual media. I took the Trailer for The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and removed the orignal audio, I then sourced and recorded new foley and effects as if i were the sound desginer for this trailer. 

I did this to improve my skills recording, designing and mixing audio. the medium of a game trailer offered me an interesting and varied breif to experiment with

I do not claim to own the witcher or this trailer, this was purely an exercise in self education and improvment
